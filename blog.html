      <h2><b>Making Apps</b></h2>
      <p><b></b></p>
      <p>
        Hey hey hey!
      <p> This is a story of a self-taught dev.
        I was doing a lot of online classes, books and tutorials. I did not feel like
        I was progressing as a dev. By a great deal of pressure from my mentor, I started making apps.
        Just using JS, jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3. (I think I must be a basic b!tch afterall).
      </p>

      <p> First, I made a simple pairing game making ajax calls to Instagram API which are shiny words for
        getting my images from Instagram. It was a crazy couple of days with ajax calls and callbacks.
        It was hard to get a grasp of. But it happened. It happened! I got it! It was such a
        joyful moment. I felt like I can concur this world. And probably Mars too.
      </p>

      <p> Anyway, then I came across to this cool web app on Twitter by accident. 2 devs seperately
        did an app that has hyperlapse videos playing along with chill music. First, I was very upset because
        how come I did not think of this before? Afterall, Instagram is my alarm clock. Wakes me up every morning
        by showing me pretty makeup pics. So I felt betrayed by my own imagination but then wanted
        to do the app on my own from scratch anyway.
      </p>

      <p>  The app gets the videos from Instagram API which I was familiar with from my first puzzle/app.
        Songs were coming from SoundCloud API which only gave me more experince with ajax calls and APIs.
        I spend around 10 days for the total app completion including some tediuos CSS work. (CSS is pure evil.)
        After completing this app, obviously I felt like I own the world (again!) including all the APIs.
        I learned so much. I could have never learned this much from just online classes or books or tutorials.
        Diving in, googling and stackoverflowing as you go is better. Way better. Just trust me on this.
        If it doesn't work out you know where to find me. I will refund your lack of experience.

      <h2><b>Learning C</b></h2>
      <p>
        Hello you!

      <p> I was scared of learning a second language after JavaScript.
        My reasoning was a bit unbelivable. I was scared that I was going to forget JavaScript once
        I learn a new language. Forget as in, cannot remember how to code in it, not as in I will fall
        in love with my new language and divorce JavaScript. I should have known better as a bilingual
        person.
      </p>

      <p> It took me a long time to build the courage to try. I was mostly influenced by a brilliant
        coder. He kept telling me that 'Without understanding how the machine works, you can never be
        a great programmer, you can only be an OK one.' Well, that was terrifying to hear. If there is
        one thing in this life that I am scared of, that is being moderate at anything I do. I simply
        refuse to be a 'just' anything.
      </p>

      <p> So I started taking <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard's CS50</a> class which is
        online, free and awesome. Prof. Malan is fantastic at explaining things in simple terms and he
        has this great energy. It is a very fun class since it is more like a highly sponsored festival
        than a class. And, I am not even that social to like festivals. There are also a few developers,
        from big companies like Dropbox, popping up in videos during class that inspires you.
      </p>

      <p> What I have been doing is: watching the lectures of Prof. Malan and the lab videos that are prepared
        by the awesome Harvard CS TAs. It was going well till week 4 and then I realized I needed a book
        to read along to confirm that I am getting all the nuances between my two languages. I found a
        <a href="http://www.sphoorthyengg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Teach-Yourself-C-in-24-Hours-2nd-Edition.pdf" target="_blank">
        free ebook</a> that is very easy to follow. It is clean and to the point.
      </p>

      <p> It was surprizingly simple to pick up another language. It is still frustrating at times (hello, debugging)
        just like any other language. The best news is that I have not forgotten how to code in JavaScript. Phew.
        That would have been a scary American Horror Story season (looking at you Ryan Murphy).
      </p>

      <p> Now, I have this feeling that I can learn any language/framework in a matter of days. It is a very
        uplifting feeling. I love learning. It makes me feel alive and powerful. Like a shark. Not like an
        investor in Shark Tank, like a real shark that bites. Except I don't. Mostly.
      </p>

      <p> Which new languages/frameworks/libraries are you learning these days?
        Till I build my website with Angular (lazy coder problems - No, I mean busy! Busy not lazy), there are no
        comment boxes. So, just say hi on Twitter!

      <h2><b>Third Step</b></h2>
      <p>2014 December</p>
      <p>  Hey you,

      <p> A lot has happened. </p>

      <p> Last time I wrote, I was attending the Foundations I course at Code Fellows. The class
        was very intense at that moment and some parts went over my head. I got scared and
        frustrated but kept going. I was very pleased when the class ended because I had time
        to study everything my teacher went over, again and on my own.
      </p>

      <p> So I took a month off and studied. I started doing the simple apps in '180 websites in 180 days'
        website, created by Jennifer Dewalt, which taught me a lot. I gained some confidence and enrolled
        the Foundations II class in JavaScript at Code Fellows.
      </p>

      <p> This time, I was feeling more confident and it showed. I understood the subjects a lot more
        easily and was able to answer some questions in class. My teacher thought I was brilliant and
        we became the bestest of friends (now, you now how to become my friend). She said I was ready for
        the last part of Code Fellows program which is also known as development accelerator (DA or dev acc).
        It is a bootcamp where you learn and code like 16 hours a day. It is intense. Well, it is a bootcamp :/
        I was accepted without even having to do the challenge that you need to submit to be able to get in
        due to my teacher's feedback.
      </p>

      <p>  Now, I had two months off to get ready. I started reading "JavaScript the Good Parts" and "Eloquent
        JavaScript" and "The definitive guide to JavaScript". All of them are fantastic books and helped me
        tremendously. They gave me a basic understanding of the language and programming in general.
      </p>

      <p> I would like to emphasize that the language should not matter as long as you are learning how to code.
        Language is just a tool. And once you know how to program it is easy to switch and learn new technologies
        and languages. I did not make this up, I promise. I was told by many experienced developers.
      </p>

      <p> It was a frantic two months in terms of getting ready because there were many resources out there and
        there was not a lot of time to complete every one of them. Also, having a lot of resources can distract
        you from focusing on the important ones. I felt like a kid in a candy store so I tried to do all of
        them at once. It would be smarter to only focus on a couple of things and learn them well rather than
        trying to do all at once.
      </p>

      <p>2014 October</p>
      <p>
        Hello world or should I say console.log("Hello, world");

      <p> That's right! I am learning a thing or two using Codecademy tutorials. One of the things
        I don't like about it that it does not give proper errors so I can fix my errors. I had
        to trial and error many times. They are all so vogue and makes you a bit mad if you are
        stuck on one question.
      </p>

      <p> Codeschool? I closed that tab so fast, it was not even visible to human eye. It was not
        free so it was not OK in a world that has a lot of free resources for beginners.
      </p>

      <p> Actually, something interesting happened this week. I saw an add for a fundamentals class
        at Code Fellows and shoot an e-mail to see if there was any last minute spot available.
        And guess what? There was! I signed up and went to the first class and lab. Oh, my my!
      </p>

      <p> Is it intense, you ask? Yes, it is. Is it fun, you ask? Yeap, for sure. I realized long
        ago that when I have a deadline and a clear direction I can learn faster than a Kardashian
        gets a divorce. And in a classroom setting, I can stay motivated and inspired. There was 150
        people in the first class and around 30 people at the lab. I was shy and talked only to 1 TA
        and 2 students in total. Everybody is very inspiring and friendly but my engineering education
        (*insert being a geek as an excuse here) made me a little introvert over the years which I
        will be working on next week! I promise! At least I will try to look into people's eyes. #notacreep
      </p>

      <p> They gave us so many assignments, it is unbelievable. I understand why it is a bootcamp. I
        already started dreaming in JS. No joke. I love deadlines. It keeps my head in the game and
        gives me purpose. Talking about deadlines, gotta run. I have a zillion deadlines before midnight.
      </p>

      <p> I bought two books as suggested by my teacher:
        Jon Duckett's CSS and HTML book
        Jon Duckett's Javascript and jQuery book
      </p>

      <p> They are my new Game of Thrones books! They are my free weights as well because they are heavy!
        Oh, before I forget Codecademy's JS and HTML tutorials are actually one of our assignments so this
        shows that they are actually useful.
      </p>

      <p> Much love! </p>

        Hello World! Or anyone?
        <p>
          How I became a Software Developer, you ask. Well, I haven't become anything yet. Emphasize on the
          'yet'! But I will! And I am keeping this diary (you only wrote once a year or two!) to share with you
          what I am doing to get there. (There meaning one of my dream companies. Yes there are more than one
          dream companies! What are you? Dream polizei?)</p>
        <p>
          I am someone who does not know how to code. No previous coding experience or knowledge. None. Nada.
          Zero. Sifir. I guess that covers my background in Computer Science. I decided to learn how to code
          because my former industry is... Hey, we don't talk about exes here. And also, coding is the coolest
          effing thing!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully, I have an amazing Software Developer by my side who constantly tries to give me advice
          and what do I do? Not listen to him of course. So far so good, yeah?
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I am doing the Codecademy's JavaScript (JS) beginner tutorials. I just started two days
          ago and so far I completed 22%. We will see if I will actually learn anything from it. I am also
          doing the CodeSchool's free JS classes (only two classes are free) just to see if it is any good.
          I will also try the Khan Academy's JS tutorials this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason I am focusing on JS is because it is everywhere. It is the language of the web. I need
          to start somewhere and JS looked like a good place to start. However, my main goal for the next
          two years is to become a proper SD who knows everything :) The best Junior SD who ever lived.
          (Read it in Harry Potter audiobook voice, otherwise it doesn't sound cool.)
        </p>
        <p>Let the journey begin!</p>
