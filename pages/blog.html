    <h2><b>Making Apps</b></h2>
    <p><b>September 2015</b></p>
    <p>
      Hey hey hey!
    <p> This is a story of a self-taught dev.
      I was doing a lot of online classes, books and tutorials. I did not feel like
      I was progressing as a dev. By a great deal of pressure from my mentor, I started making apps.
      Just using JS, jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3. (I think I must be a basic b!tch afterall).
    </p>
    <p> First, I made a simple pairing game making ajax calls to Instagram API which are shiny words for
      getting my images from Instagram. It was a crazy couple of days with ajax calls and callbacks.
      It was hard to get a grasp of. But it happened. It happened! I got it! It was such a
      joyful moment. I felt like I can concur this world. And probably Mars too.
    </p>
    <p> Anyway, then I came across to this cool web app on Twitter by accident. 2 devs seperately
      did an app that has hyperlapse videos playing along with chill music. First, I was very upset because
      how come I did not think of this before? Afterall, Instagram is my alarm clock. Wakes me up every morning
      by showing me pretty makeup pics. So I felt betrayed by my own imagination but then wanted
      to do the app on my own from scratch anyway.
    </p>
    <p> The app gets the videos from Instagram API which I was familiar with from my first puzzle/app.
      Songs were coming from SoundCloud API which only gave me more experince with ajax calls and APIs.
      I spend around 10 days for the total app completion including some tediuos CSS work. (CSS is pure evil.)
      After completing this app, obviously I felt like I own the world (again!) including all the APIs.
      I learned so much. I could have never learned this much from just online classes or books or tutorials.
      Diving in, googling and stackoverflowing as you go is better. Way better. Just trust me on this.
      If it doesn't work out you know where to find me. I will refund your lack of experience.

      <h2><b>Learning C</b></h2>
      <p><b>July 2015</b></p>
      <p>
        Hello you!
      <p> I was scared of learning a second language after JavaScript.
        My reasoning was a bit unbelivable. I was scared that I was going to forget JavaScript once
        I learn a new language. Forget as in, cannot remember how to code in it, not as in I will fall
        in love with my new language and divorce JavaScript. I should have known better as a bilingual
        person.
      </p>
      <p> It took me a long time to build the courage to try. I was mostly influenced by a brilliant
        coder. He kept telling me that 'Without understanding how the machine works, you can never be
        a great programmer, you can only be an OK one.' Well, that was terrifying to hear. If there is
        one thing in this life that I am scared of, that is being moderate at anything I do. I simply
        refuse to be a 'just' anything.
      </p>
      <p> So I started taking <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard's CS50</a> class which is
        online, free and awesome. Prof. Malan is fantastic at explaining things in simple terms and he
        has this great energy. It is a very fun class since it is more like a highly sponsored festival
        than a class. And, I am not even that social to like festivals. There are also a few developers,
        from big companies like Dropbox, popping up in videos during class that inspires you.
      </p>
      <p> What I have been doing is: watching the lectures of Prof. Malan and the lab videos that are prepared
        by the awesome Harvard CS TAs. It was going well till week 4 and then I realized I needed a book
        to read along to confirm that I am getting all the nuances between my two languages. I found a
        <a href="http://www.sphoorthyengg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Teach-Yourself-C-in-24-Hours-2nd-Edition.pdf" target="_blank">
        free ebook</a> that is very easy to follow. It is clean and to the point.
      </p>
      <p> It was surprizingly simple to pick up another language. It is still frustrating at times (hello, debugging)
        just like any other language. The best news is that I have not forgotten how to code in JavaScript. Phew.
        That would have been a scary American Horror Story season (looking at you Ryan Murphy).
      </p>
      <p> Now, I have this feeling that I can learn any language/framework in a matter of days. It is a very
        uplifting feeling. I love learning. It makes me feel alive and powerful. Like a shark. Not like an
        investor in Shark Tank, like a real shark that bites. Except I don't. Mostly.
      </p>
      <p> Which new languages/frameworks/libraries are you learning these days?
        Till I build my website with Angular (lazy coder problems - No, I mean busy! Busy not lazy), there are no
        comment boxes. So, just say hi on Twitter!

      <h2><b>Big Step</b></h2>
      <p><b>March 2015</b></p>
      <p> Hi!
      <p> I went to Code Fellows JavaScript Dev Acc bootcamp and it was awesome. Ok, that sounded sponsored.
        Let's try again. Take 2! It was intense, stressful, tiring, exciting, fun and eye opening. It was 8 weeks of
        intense coding labor. Lots of reading (who would have thought) and a lot (A LOT) of deadlines. Constant
        homework doing. Constant coffee drinking. 3 hours of class every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursdays were
        for algorithms and data structures classes and whiteboard parties. Fridays were just guest speakers (not my favorite part).
      </p>
      <p> Nights and weekends you ask? No nights or weekends because you are either doing homework or trying to catch
        up with whatever you learned (were supposed to learn) 3 weeks ago when the class just started. It was a very
        fast paced course. We all dreamed JS at some point when we get a few hours of sleep at nights.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am someone who have 2 master's degrees and a bachelor's in engineering so I know hard, I know tough, I know
        intimidating and this was all of it bundled up with so many inspiring aspiring developers in a room. There were
        people who are 19 and there were people who are 50. They all loved what they did. It was humbling to be a part of.
        Everyone in there were there to change their lives. To become something they probably wanted (or supposed to be)
        long time ago. I really loved my classmates and teachers and I still see some of them everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are someone who is thinking of doing something similar, I have some tips I would like to offer and wish
        somebody offered me before I went.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Learn programming before you attend to a bootcamp. Bootcamps do not teach you programming. They teach you tools.
        We never saw anything about JS. We saw Angular, Express, Mongo, Node and React. If you already know how to program
        (which does not mean writing 'hello world' or 2 + 2) which means making little apps on your own and being able
        to solve all the easy and medium questions on Coderbyte.com, then you are good to go. If not, learn programming!
        Otherwise, you will try to run before you can crawl. No bueno.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Be familiar with the subjects beforehand. You do not have to master them but be familiar because as my teacher
        kept saying it takes 3 times to learn most of CS concepts. First time you don't get it. Second time you think you get
        it. Third time 'aha' you sorta kinda get it. If you already have ideas on the tool you will be taught, it will be
        so much easier and fun for you. You will get so much more out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Don't be 2 things: a smartass knowitall and a person who is paralized by fear. I promise you. However much you think
        you know, you know nothing Jon Snow. Yeah, I just did that. #sorrynotsorry. Programming is something you can never know
        it all. Never ever. Also, do not get intimidated by thinking how much you don't know. You will always be feeling like
        you don't know sh!t. And, that feeling will never go away. Be fine with it. Just be a better dev than you were yesterday.
        Work harder today than you did yesterday. Keep at it and code away. That is how you will get less sucky.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess this is it! I would certainly do it again. I loved every minute of it. I just wish I was more ready for it.
        But that is what today is for. I will keep learning until I suck less. So should you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you are wondering where my classmates are right now. I believe, almost all of them are working as developers at great
        places like Expedia. I was offered a TA position right before graduation so I volunteered for a non-profit project
        to teach web development which I loved. And currently, I am waiting for my green card so I can finally start interviewing
        and working for one of my dream companies. Only a few months left :) Till then, I am coding coding coding.
      </p>
        So happy coding to us all!

      <h2><b>Third Step</b></h2>
      <p><b>December 2014</b></p>
      <p> Hey you,
      <p> A lot has happened. </p>
      <p> Last time I wrote, I was attending the Foundations I course at Code Fellows. The class
        was very intense at that moment and some parts went over my head. I got scared and
        frustrated but kept going. I was very pleased when the class ended because I had time
        to study everything my teacher went over, again and on my own.
      </p>
      <p> So I took a month off and studied. I started doing the simple apps in '180 websites in 180 days'
        website, created by Jennifer Dewalt, which taught me a lot. I gained some confidence and enrolled
        the Foundations II class in JavaScript at Code Fellows.
      </p>
      <p> This time, I was feeling more confident and it showed. I understood the subjects a lot more
        easily and was able to answer some questions in class. My teacher thought I was brilliant and
        we became the bestest of friends (now, you now how to become my friend). She said I was ready for
        the last part of Code Fellows program which is also known as development accelerator (DA or dev acc).
        It is a bootcamp where you learn and code like 16 hours a day. It is intense. Well, it is a bootcamp :/
        I was accepted without even having to do the challenge that you need to submit to be able to get in
        due to my teacher's feedback.
      </p>
      <p> Now, I had two months off to get ready. I started reading "JavaScript the Good Parts" and "Eloquent
        JavaScript" and "The definitive guide to JavaScript". All of them are fantastic books and helped me
        tremendously. They gave me a basic understanding of the language and programming in general.
      </p>
      <p> I would like to emphasize that the language should not matter as long as you are learning how to code.
        Language is just a tool. And once you know how to program it is easy to switch and learn new technologies
        and languages. I did not make this up, I promise. I was told by many experienced developers.
      </p>
      <p> It was a frantic two months in terms of getting ready because there were many resources out there and
        there was not a lot of time to complete every one of them. Also, having a lot of resources can distract
        you from focusing on the important ones. I felt like a kid in a candy store so I tried to do all of
        them at once. It would be smarter to only focus on a couple of things and learn them well rather than
        trying to do all at once.

      <p>
        Hello world or should I say console.log("Hello, world");
      <p> That's right! I am learning a thing or two using Codecademy tutorials. One of the things
        I don't like about it that it does not give proper errors so I can fix my errors. I had
        to trial and error many times. They are all so vogue and makes you a bit mad if you are
        stuck on one question.
      </p>
      <p> Codeschool? I closed that tab so fast, it was not even visible to human eye. It was not
        free so it was not OK in a world that has a lot of free resources for beginners.
      </p>
      <p> Actually, something interesting happened this week. I saw an add for a fundamentals class
        at Code Fellows and shoot an e-mail to see if there was any last minute spot available.
        And guess what? There was! I signed up and went to the first class and lab. Oh, my my!
      </p>
      <p> Is it intense, you ask? Yes, it is. Is it fun, you ask? Yeap, for sure. I realized long
        ago that when I have a deadline and a clear direction I can learn faster than a Kardashian
        gets a divorce. And in a classroom setting, I can stay motivated and inspired. There was 150
        people in the first class and around 30 people at the lab. I was shy and talked only to 1 TA
        and 2 students in total. Everybody is very inspiring and friendly but my engineering education
        (*insert being a geek as an excuse here) made me a little introvert over the years which I
        will be working on next week! I promise! At least I will try to look into people's eyes. #notacreep
      </p>
      <p> They gave us so many assignments, it is unbelievable. I understand why it is a bootcamp. I
        already started dreaming in JS. No joke. I love deadlines. It keeps my head in the game and
        gives me purpose. Talking about deadlines, gotta run. I have a zillion deadlines before midnight.
      </p>
      <p> I bought two books as suggested by my teacher:
        Jon Duckett's CSS and HTML book
        Jon Duckett's Javascript and jQuery book
      </p>
      <p> They are my new Game of Thrones books! They are my free weights as well because they are heavy!
        Oh, before I forget Codecademy's JS and HTML tutorials are actually one of our assignments so this
        shows that they are actually useful.
      </p>
      <p> Much love! </p>

        Hello World! Or anyone?
        <p>
          How I became a Software Developer, you ask. Well, I haven't become anything yet. Emphasize on the
          'yet'! But I will! And I am keeping this diary (you only wrote once a year or two!) to share with you
          what I am doing to get there. (There meaning one of my dream companies. Yes there are more than one
          dream companies! What are you? Dream polizei?)
        </p>
        <p>
          I am someone who does not know how to code. No previous coding experience or knowledge. None. Nada.
          Zero. Sifir. I guess that covers my background in Computer Science. I decided to learn how to code
          because my former industry is... Hey, we don't talk about exes here. And also, coding is the coolest
          effing thing!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully, I have an amazing Software Developer by my side who constantly tries to give me advice
          and what do I do? Not listen to him of course. So far so good, yeah?
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I am doing the Codecademy's JavaScript (JS) beginner tutorials. I just started two days
          ago and so far I completed 22%. We will see if I will actually learn anything from it. I am also
          doing the CodeSchool's free JS classes (only two classes are free) just to see if it is any good.
          I will also try the Khan Academy's JS tutorials this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason I am focusing on JS is because it is everywhere. It is the language of the web. I need
          to start somewhere and JS looked like a good place to start. However, my main goal for the next
          two years is to become a proper SD who knows everything :) The best Junior SD who ever lived.
          (Read it in Harry Potter audiobook voice, otherwise it doesn't sound cool.)
        </p>
        <p>Let the journey begin!</p>
