    <h2><b>Learning C</b></h2>
    <p><b>June 26, 2015</b></p>

    <p>
      Hello you!

      <p>I was scared of learning a second language after JavaScript.
      My reasoning was a bit unbeliable. I was scared that I was going to forget JavaScript once
      I learn a new language. Forget as in, cannot remember how to code in it, not as in I will fall
      in love with my new language and divorce JavaScript. I should have known better as a bilingual person.</p>

      <p> It took me a long time to build the
      courage to try. I was mostly influenced by a brilliant coder. He kept telling me
      'Without understanding how the machine works, you can never be a great programmer, you can
      only be an OK one.' Well that was terrifying to hear. If there is one thing in this life that I am scared
      of, that is being moderate at anything I do. I simply refuse to be a 'just' anything.</p>

      <p>So I started taking Harvard's CS50 class which is online, free and awesome. Prof. Malan is
      fantastic at explaining things in simple terms and he has this great energy. It is a very fun class since it is like a
      highly sponsored festival. And I am not even that social to like festivals. There are also a few
      developers, from big companies like Dropbox, popping up in videos during class to inspire you. </p>

      <p>What I have been doing is watching the lectures of Prof. Malan and the lab videos that are prepared
      by the awesome Harvard students/TAs. It was going well till week 4 and then I realized I needed a book
      to read along to confirm that I am getting all the nuances between my two languages.
      I found a <a href="http://www.sphoorthyengg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Teach-Yourself-C-in-24-Hours-2nd-Edition.pdf">
      free ebook</a> that is very easy to follow.</p>

      <p>It was surprizingly simple to pick up another language. The best news is that I have not forgotten
      how to code in JavaScript. Phew. That would have been a scary American Horror Story season (looking
      at you Ryan Murphy).</p>

      <p>Now, I have this feeling that I can learn every language
      in a matter of days. It is a very uplifting feeling. I love learning. It makes me feel alive and
      powerful. Like a shark. Not like an investor in Shark Tank, like a real shark that bites. Except I don't.
      Mostly.</p>

      <p>Which new languages/frameworks/libraries are you learning these days?
      Till I build my website with Angular (lazy coder problems - I mean busy! Busy not lazy), there are no
      comment boxes. So, just say hi on Twitter!</p>
