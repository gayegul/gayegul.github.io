A day in the life of a coder

I am far from an adult with ADHD. On the contrary, I am a very focused person.
Unless I am studying programming. Then I am all over the place.

9:00 am

me - I am finishing my website today!
other me - Maybe after studying some data structures?
me - That reminds me, I need to complete Codewars' challenges. *solves 1 question*
other me - Oh I am so smart! I am like the girl with the Dragon tattoo.
me - Coderbyte wait for me babe, I will be right there!
other me - How did I do that Twitter oAuth again?
me - I have a bug somewhere. Buggy bug bug, where are you? *spends an hour*
other me - Am I dumb? I might be dumb!
me - I swear, I solved this problem before.
other me - Uuu there is an algorithms class from Princeton?!
me - I need to finish 'Cracking the Coding Interview' book.
other me - I should restart watching the Harvard cs50 class.
me - Gotta learn Java at some point. Or should I learn C?
other me - Meteor community is getting bigger?! Do a todo list or something. Quick.

2:00 am

Yeah, this was my day.
Again.
How was yours?
