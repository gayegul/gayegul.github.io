    <h2><b>How I became a software developer?</b></h2>
    <p><b>September 2, 2014</b></p>

    <p>
      Hello everyone! Or anyone?

    <p>How I became a Software Developer, you ask. Well, I am still working on that.</p>

    <p>I am someone who did not know how to code. No previous coding experience or
      knowledge. None. Nada. Zero. Sifir. I guess, that covers my background in
      Computer Science. So far so good, yeah? I decided to learn how to code because...
      Well, that is another blog post all together.</p>

    <p>Hmmm. Where to start though? Those were my thoughts exactly. There were/are so
      many resources available online, it is borderline between exciting and frustrating.
      As many self taught programmers out there, I started with Codecademy tutorials. There
      was also a Coursera class on Python. Then I learned about other online and free
      resources and started playing with them little by little. I was living in a small town
      at the time and there were no coding schools or people that were changing careers to
      open my mind to the possibility of becoming a software developer.
      </p>
